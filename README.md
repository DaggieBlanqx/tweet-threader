# Tweet threader
Create threads on Twitter easily.

The main purpose of this app was to learn Redux and also explore
the use of `Generators` and `promises` to achieve synchronous(ish) actions.

Each tweet had to be posted after the previous one has been successful and also, the number of tweets are dynamic so Promise chaining would be useless.

`Generators` + `Promises` = Powerful.
